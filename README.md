# Remaning-Useful-Life-
The main goal is to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of each engine. RUL is equivalent of number of flights remained for the engine after the last data point in the test dataset.

### Details
By the analysis of the sesnor data mesured at the different cycle the regression model is trained so that in future the failure of engine can predicted before hand.
